 * <p>Functions for setting up tables that can later be used to find moves fast.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There is no table for Queen moves, we simply take the sum of Bishop and Rook moves.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The methods here don't take into account the general rule that the target field must not
 * have a figure of the same color. For example, a Bishop on c1 will always be able to 
 * "move" to b2 and d2. This allows generation of possible moves as well as detection of coverage.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For Bishop/Rook, we return a bitmap of the fields that need to be free for the move to be
 * valid. Hence, 0 means the move is possible, and -1 means it is not possible (unless the board was completly empty).</p>
